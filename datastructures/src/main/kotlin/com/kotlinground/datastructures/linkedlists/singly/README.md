Singly Linked list implementation in Kotlin

## Delete the middle Node of a Linked List

You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the middle node of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing.

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

```plain
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node. 
```

```plain
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
```

```plain
Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
```

### Solution(s)

#### Approach 1: 2 Passes

##### Intuition

Let's start with a simple approach.

We make the first iteration, starting from head, going through the entire linked list and getting the total number of
nodes (let's say `node_count`). According to the definition provided, the index of the middle node is:
`middleIndex=floor(node_count / 2)−1`.

Now we make a second iteration to the `predecessor` node of the middle node, which means that we stop at index
`middleIndex - 1`.

Once we reach the predecessor node of the middle node, we can remove the middle node from the linked list.

##### Algorithm

1. If there is only one node, return None.
2. Otherwise, initialize two pointers p1 = head and p2 = head.
3. Iterate the linked list with p1 and count the total number of nodes it has (count).
4. Let p2 move forward by floor(node_count / 2) - 1 nodes, now it is the predecessor of the middle node, delete the
   middle node. Return the middle node.

```kotlin
fun <T> deleteMiddle(head: SinglyLinkedListNode<T>?): SinglyLinkedListNode<T>? {
    if (head == null || head?.next == null) {
        return null
    }

    var nodeCount = 0
    var pointer = head
    var current = head

    while (pointer != null) {
        nodeCount++
        pointer = pointer.next
    }

    val middleIndex = nodeCount / 2

    for (x in 0 until middleIndex - 1) {
        current = current?.next
    }

    val middleNode = current?.next

    current?.next = current?.next?.next

    return middleNode
}
```

##### Complexity Analysis

Let `n` be the length of the input linked list.

1. `Time complexity: O(n)`

    - We iterate over the linked list twice, the first time traversing the entire linked list and the second traversing
      half of it. Hence there are a total of `O(n)` steps.
    - In each step, we move a pointer forward by one node, which takes constant time.
    - Remove the middle node takes a constant amount of time.
    - In summary, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

2. `Space complexity: O(1)`

    - We only need two pointers, thus the space complexity is `O(1)`.

#### Approach 2: 2 Pointers

##### Intuition

The key of this approach is that we have two pointers `fast` and `slow` traversing the linked list at the same time, and
`fast` traverses twice as fast as `slow`. Therefore, when `fast` reaches the end of the linked list, `slow` is right in
the middle! We only need one iteration to reach the middle node!

All that needs to be determined are a few lookup details. If there is only one node in the linked list, this node is
also the one to be deleted and there are no nodes left after the deletion. Therefore, instead of initializing two
pointers for the following procedure, we can just return null.

> Why we initialize fast = head.next.next at the beginning?

The reason for this is that we want to delete the middle node instead of finding it. Therefore, we are actually looking
for the `predecessor` of the middle node, not the middle node itself, or rather, this is like moving slow backward one
node after the iteration stops.

Certainly, we can't move a pointer backward on a singly linked list, thus we can show this one less step on `slow` by
letting `fast` moves forward one more step (by two nodes, of course). Hence, `slow` will also point to the predecessor
node of the middle node (rather than the middle node) at the end of the iteration.

##### Algorithm

1. If there is only one node, return null.
2. Otherwise, initialize two pointers `slow` and `fast`, with slow pointing to head and fast pointing to the second
   successor node of head.
3. While neither `fast` and `fast.next` is `null`:
    - we move `fast` forward by 2 nodes.
    - we move `slow` forward by 1 node.
4. Now `slow` is the predecessor of the middle node, delete the middle node.
5. Return middle node.

```kotlin
fun <T> deleteMiddle2Pointers(head: SinglyLinkedListNode<T>?): SinglyLinkedListNode<T>? {
    if (head == null || head?.next == null) {
        return null
    }

    var slowPointer = head
    var fastPointer = head?.next?.next

    while (fastPointer?.next != null) {
        slowPointer = slowPointer?.next
        fastPointer = fastPointer.next?.next
    }

    val middleNode = slowPointer?.next

    slowPointer?.next = slowPointer?.next?.next

    return middleNode
}
```

> Note that the implementation outlined here is what is denoted in the instance method `delete_middle_node_2_pointers`
> of the class [SinglyLinkedList](SinglyLinkedList.kt) with some slight modifications

##### Complexity Analysis

1. `Time Complexity O(n)`
    - We stop the iteration when the pointer fast reaches the end, fast moves forward 2 nodes per step, so there are at
      most `n/2` steps.
    - In each step, we move both `fast` and `slow`, which takes a constant amount of time.
    - Removing the middle node also takes constant time.
    - In summary, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

2. `Space Complexity O(1)`

    - We only need 2 pointers, so the space complexity is `O(1)`

## Odd Even Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even
indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

```plain
Example 1:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5]

becomes:

1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]

Example 2:

2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 4 -> 7
2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4

Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

### Solution

#### Intuition

Put the odd nodes in a linked list and the even nodes in another. Then link the evenList to the tail of the oddList.

#### Algorithm

The solution is very intuitive. But it is not trivial to write a concise and bug-free code.

A well-formed LinkedList need two pointers head and tail to support operations at both ends. The variables head and odd
are the head pointer and tail pointer of one LinkedList we call oddList; the variables evenHead and even are the head
pointer and tail pointer of another LinkedList we call evenList. The algorithm traverses the original LinkedList and put
the odd nodes into the oddList and the even nodes into the evenList. To traverse a LinkedList we need at least one
pointer as an iterator for the current node. But here the pointers odd and even not only serve as the tail pointers but
also act as the iterators of the original list.

#### Complexity Analysis

##### Time Complexity O(n)

There are total n nodes and we visit each node once.

##### Space Complexity O(1)

All we need is the four pointers.
